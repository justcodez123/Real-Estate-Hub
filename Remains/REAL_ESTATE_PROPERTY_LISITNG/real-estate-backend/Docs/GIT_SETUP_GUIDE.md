# Git Setup & Push Guide

## Issue: `git push origin main` - "src refspec main does not match any"

This error occurs when the `main` branch doesn't exist locally. Here's how to fix it:

---

## Solution 1: Using Main Branch (Recommended)

### Step 1: Check Current Branch
```bash
git branch
# Should show current branch (e.g., master or main)
```

### Step 2: If Current Branch is Master, Rename to Main
```bash
git branch -m master main
# This renames master to main locally
```

### Step 3: Create Main on Remote
```bash
git push -u origin main
# This creates main on GitHub and sets tracking
```

---

## Solution 2: Using Master Branch

If you want to keep using master:

```bash
# Push master branch
git push -u origin master

# Or if origin/master already exists:
git push origin master
```

---

## Complete Setup Steps

### Initial Setup (First Time)

```bash
# Navigate to project
cd "D:\CDAC Project\Atharva\Atharva\real-estate-backend"

# Check git status
git status

# Add all files
git add .

# Commit changes
git commit -m "Add new features: Registration, Agent Login, Favorites, Viewings, Images, Builder Groups"

# List branches
git branch -a

# If you see only master:
git branch -m master main

# Push to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

### Future Pushes

```bash
# After making changes
git add .
git commit -m "Your commit message"
git push origin main  # Or just: git push
```

---

## Step-by-Step for Your Project

```powershell
# PowerShell commands
cd "D:\CDAC Project\Atharva\Atharva\real-estate-backend"

# Check current state
git status

# View branches
git branch -a

# If master exists, rename to main
git branch -m master main

# Stage all new files
git add .

# Check what will be committed
git status

# Commit with descriptive message
git commit -m "feat: Add 6 new features - Registration, Agent Login, Favorites with Pagination, Schedule Viewing, Property Images, Builder Groups Filter"

# Push to GitHub
git push -u origin main

# Verify push was successful
git log --oneline -5
```

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: "fatal: 'origin' does not appear to be a git repository"
```bash
# Solution: Initialize git
git init
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/real-estate-backend.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

### Issue 2: "Permission denied (publickey)"
```bash
# Solution: Use HTTPS instead of SSH
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/real-estate-backend.git
git push -u origin main
```

### Issue 3: "Branch 'main' does not exist"
```bash
# Solution: Create and push main branch
git branch -m master main
git push -u origin main
```
