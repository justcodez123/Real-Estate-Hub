## 🎯 The 3 Relationship Types (TL;DR)

### 1️⃣ ONE-TO-MANY (1:N) & MANY-TO-ONE (N:1)
- **Same relationship**, different perspectives
- One parent can have many children
- FK goes on child table
- Use `@OneToMany` on parent, `@ManyToOne` on child
- Examples in your project:
  - User owns Property
  - Property has PropertyImage
  - BuilderGroup has Property
  - User has Favorite
  - User has SearchHistory

### 2️⃣ ONE-TO-ONE (1:1)
- Each side has exactly one of the other
- **Requires UNIQUE constraint on FK**
- Use `@OneToOne` on both sides
- Example in your project:
  - User has Subscription

### 3️⃣ MANY-TO-MANY (N:M)
- Multiple on both sides
- Requires junction table
- Example in your project:
  - User favorites Property (via Favorite table)

## 🎯 Key Concepts at a Glance

### Foreign Keys
```
❌ WRONG: FK on parent side
✅ RIGHT: FK on child/many side

User (parent)
  ↓
Property (child) ← FK goes here!
```

### Cascade Operations
```
CascadeType.ALL means:
DELETE parent → DELETE children
SAVE parent → SAVE children
UPDATE parent → UPDATE children
```

### Lazy vs Eager Loading
```
LAZY (default, better): Load when accessed
EAGER (avoid): Load immediately
```

### One-to-One Special Feature
```
UNIQUE constraint on FK:
Makes it truly 1:1 at database level
Prevents one side from having 2 of the other
```

### mappedBy Usage
```
@OneToMany(mappedBy = "owner")
                         ↑
              Points to field in child class
              that owns the relationship
```
