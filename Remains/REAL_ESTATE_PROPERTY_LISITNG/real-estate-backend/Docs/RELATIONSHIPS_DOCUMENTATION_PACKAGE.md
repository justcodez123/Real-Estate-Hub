## 🎯 The 3 Relationship Types Explained (TL;DR)

### Type 1: ONE-TO-MANY (1:N) & MANY-TO-ONE (N:1)
```
Definition: One parent has many children
Same Relationship: Just different perspectives
FK Location: Child table (properties.owner_id)
Parent Code: @OneToMany(mappedBy="owner")
Child Code: @ManyToOne @JoinColumn(name="owner_id")

Your Examples:
- User owns Properties
- Property has PropertyImages
- BuilderGroup has Properties
- User has Favorites
- User has SearchHistories
```

### Type 2: ONE-TO-ONE (1:1)
```
Definition: Each side has exactly one
Special Feature: UNIQUE constraint on FK
FK Location: Either side (typically owning side)
Parent Code: @OneToOne(mappedBy="user")
Child Code: @OneToOne @JoinColumn(unique=true)

Your Example:
- User has Subscription (UNIQUE FK enforces 1:1)
```

### Type 3: MANY-TO-MANY (N:M)
```
Definition: Multiple on both sides
Implementation: Junction table required
Junction Table: Has both FKs
Constraint: UNIQUE on (FK1, FK2) combo

Your Example:
- User favorites Property (via Favorite table)
```

## 💡 Key Insights You'll Learn

### Insight 1: One-to-Many = Many-to-One
> These are the SAME relationship viewed from different sides!
> Just different perspectives of the same data relationship.

### Insight 2: Foreign Key Always on MANY Side
> This is a core database principle.
> Child table ALWAYS has the foreign key.

### Insight 3: One-to-One Needs UNIQUE Constraint
> Without UNIQUE, it's not truly one-to-one.
> UNIQUE constraint enforces the 1:1 at database level.

### Insight 4: Cascade Propagates Changes
> When parent is saved/updated/deleted, children follow.
> Be careful what you cascade!

### Insight 5: Lazy Loading is Better
> LAZY: Load only when accessed (default, better)
> EAGER: Load immediately (use sparingly)

### Insight 6: orphanRemoval Deletes Children
> When child removed from collection, it's deleted from DB.
> Useful for true parent-child relationships.

### Insight 7: mappedBy Prevents Duplicate FKs
> Points to the field that owns the relationship.
> Both sides aware of each other without duplicate FKs.
