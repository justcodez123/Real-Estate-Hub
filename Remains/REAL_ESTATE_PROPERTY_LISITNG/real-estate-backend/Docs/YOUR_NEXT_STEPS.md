## ✅ IMMEDIATE ACTIONS

### Step 1: Build the Project (5 minutes)
```powershell
cd "D:\CDAC Project\Atharva\Atharva\real-estate-backend"
mvn clean compile
mvn clean package
```

**What to expect:**
- Maven downloads dependencies
- Code compiles without errors
- JAR file created in `target/` folder

**If you see errors:**
- Check Java version: `java -version` (should be 17+)
- Check Maven: `mvn -v`
- Check MySQL is running

---

### Step 2: Run the Application (2 minutes)
```powershell
java -jar target/real-estate-backend-1.0.0.jar
```

**You should see:**
```
Application started...
Server running on http://localhost:8080
```

**Keep terminal open** - Application will run in foreground

---

### Step 3: Test the Features (15 minutes)
Pick one of these guides:

**QUICK TEST (5 min):**
```
Open: QUICK_START_FEATURES.md
Use: Copy curl commands from "Feature 1"
Test: Run one endpoint to verify it works
```

**COMPLETE TEST (15 min):**
```
Open: API_TESTING_GUIDE.md
Follow: "Complete User Journey Example"
Test: All 6 features end-to-end
```

**Use Postman (10 min):**
```
Copy: curl commands from API_TESTING_GUIDE.md
Paste: Into Postman as HTTP requests
Test: All endpoints with nice UI
```

## 📋 Verification Checklist

Run these quick tests to verify everything works:

### Test 1: Register a User
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/auth/register \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"firstName":"Test","lastName":"User","email":"test@test.com","password":"pass123","confirmPassword":"pass123","phone":"555-1234","userType":"BUYER"}'
```
✅ Should return: User ID and profile data

### Test 2: Create Builder Group
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/builder-groups \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name":"TestBuilder","description":"Test","active":true}'
```
✅ Should return: Builder ID and details

### Test 3: Add Favorite
```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8080/api/favorites?userId=1&propertyId=1"
```
✅ Should return: Favorite ID (or error if property doesn't exist)

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Problem: "Port 8080 already in use"
```powershell
# Kill process using port 8080
netstat -ano | findstr :8080
taskkill /PID <PID> /F

# Or run on different port
java -jar -Dserver.port=8081 target/real-estate-backend-1.0.0.jar
```

### Problem: "Build fails with compilation errors"
```
• Check README_FEATURES.md - Section "Build & Run"
• Verify Java 17+: java -version
• Clean Maven cache: mvn clean
• Check file paths
```

### Problem: "MySQL connection refused"
```
• Check MySQL is running: mysql -u root -p
• Verify connection string in application.properties
• Default: localhost:3306, user: root, password: root
```

### Problem: "Endpoints return 404 Not Found"
```
• Verify app is running on http://localhost:8080
• Check endpoint URLs are correct
• Verify HTTP method (GET/POST/PUT/DELETE)
• See API_TESTING_GUIDE.md for exact formats
```
