# ✅ Agent Dashboard - Created & Fixed Blank Page Issue

**Status**: ✅ **COMPLETE**  
**Date**: January 28, 2026  
**Issue**: Blank page after agent login - Route not found

---

## 🐛 Problem Identified

### Issue
After agent login, the page redirected to `/agent-dashboard` but showed a blank page.

### Root Cause
The `/agent-dashboard` route didn't exist in the application.

Agent Login was trying to redirect to:
```javascript
const from = location.state?.from?.pathname || '/agent-dashboard';
navigate(from, { replace: true });
```

But there was no route defined for `/agent-dashboard`.
