**Status**: ✅ CSS Changes Applied  
**Action Required**: Browser Refresh Needed

---

## ✅ What Was Done

**File**: `src/components/SubscriptionManagement.css`

**Changes Applied**:
```css
.btn-primary {
    padding: 8px 16px !important;      /* Reduced from 12px 24px */
    font-size: 14px !important;        /* Reduced from 16px */

## 🔄 Why No Change in UI Yet

The CSS file has been updated, but the browser is still showing the old version because:
- Browser cache still has old CSS
- Development server hasn't reloaded the styles
- Page hasn't refreshed to load new CSS

---

## 🚀 How to See the Changes

### Quick Fix (Hard Refresh)

**Windows/Linux**: `Ctrl + Shift + R`

**Mac**: `Cmd + Shift + R`

---

### Or Restart Development Server

1. Stop server: `Ctrl + C`
2. Start server: `npm start`
3. Wait for "Compiled successfully"
